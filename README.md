Delusion manifesto

Create website at cubeslave.IO domain
Preface: "Breaking barriers between visionary and delusionary"
NFT is about creating value where there is no value
Let's take our position in the game

Stream the process on Twitch, i.e. creating website>brainstorming projects/modules/ecosystem
Viewers contribute with assets/opinions/workarounds/problemsolving
Hype is real

Communicate idea of creating value where there is no value > keep building on it

Contributors create NFT's -> We assign wallet IDs in royalty parameter - if they get sold we generate royalty revenue for future transactions.
Contributors get to contribute at their own pace, i.e. development for grand production of NFT for automated creation.

Community - Contriburs INPUT/OUTPUT

Blockchain technology
Somewhat transparency

Value should arise over time
Marketing/Developing - Producing vs Consuming

Profit?
